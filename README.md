# Leafy-Flights Projects

## Description

The Flappy Bird Game project is a recreation of the immensely popular mobile game "Flappy Bird." The game is built using fundamental web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a browser-based version of this addictive and challenging game.


## Game Mechanics

The gameplay revolves around controlling a bird, which the player navigates through an obstacle course of pipes. The objective is to keep the bird airborne by tapping the spacebar or clicking the mouse, allowing it to ascend slightly and avoid collision with the pipes. Each successful passage through a pair of pipes earns the player a point, incrementing the score. The game continues indefinitely until the bird collides with a pipe or hits the ground, ending the session.

## Key Features

• Responsive Design: The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring a      consistent and enjoyable experience across various devices and screen sizes.

• Simple Controls: The control mechanism is straightforward—tapping the spacebar or clicking the mouse triggers the bird's flap, enabling it to maneuver through the obstacles.

• Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, providing a means to measure progress and compete for high scores.

• Visual and Auditory Experience (optional): Enhancements such as engaging visual elements and sound effects can be added to elevate the gaming experience.

## Development Approach

The project utilizes HTML to structure the game layout, CSS for styling elements and creating animations, and JavaScript to handle game logic, including the bird's movement, collision detection, score tracking, and game state management.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to showcase the implementation of a classic game using basic web technologies. It serves as an educational resource for beginners learning web development, offering insights into game development principles, event handling, and basic animation techniques using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
